        I am a dedicated student and a quick learner who is artistic by nature. I am currently searching for learnership/internship opportunities to further enhance my capability and experience in the IT sector. I do understand that would mean me commencing employment at a junior level of which I am prepared to do. I also believe that due to my hunger for continuous improvement and learning, I would be able to add value to your organisation. My bubbly extroverted personality will ensure that I am an integral team player that thrives in a high-pressure environment.
